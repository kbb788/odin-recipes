    <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Our family has been making this recipe several times each year since 2008. These are not your traditional chewy, chocolate chip cookies and instead could be described as a cross between a chocolate chip cookie and a muffin.
            They are real crowd pleasers and a long-time favorite among the cousins in our family.
            <br> 
            <br>
            This recipe is slightly adapted from Martha Stewart's original recipe which can be found <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/326616/soft-chocolate-chip-cookies">here</a>.
         </p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon coarse salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>7 tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>¼ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup light-brown sugar, packed</li>
        <li>1 egg, large, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons sour cream</li>
        <li>¾ cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>¾ cup milk-chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking soda. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar on medium-high speed until the mixture is pale and fluffy (about 3 to 5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add the egg and vanilla extract to the butter mixture and beat until fully incorporated.</li>
        <li>Reduce mixer speed to low.</li>
        <li>Add half of the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined.</li>
        <li>Add the sour cream and mix until just combined.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining flour mixture and mix again until just combined.</li>
        <li>Stir in the semisweet and milk chocolate chips by hand using a spatula or wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough and freeze it for 10 minutes to firm it up slightly.</li>
        <li>Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Using a 1 1/2-inch ice cream scoop or a tablespoon, drop dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing the scoops about 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Flatten each scoop of dough slightly with your fingers or the back of a spoon.</li>
        <li>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for 12 to 14 minutes, or until the centers are set and the edges are a pale golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
